# JZK EDA Libraries

## Overview
This contains Library footprints of some optimized components I use in my KiCAD PCB design. They include the zigzag header footprints, which have a 5 mil offset do that the header pins friction fit in place (instead of falling out when the board is flipped over).

The Eagle version of this can be found with the Sparkfun Eagle library: https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun-Eagle-Libraries/blob/master/SparkFun-Connectors.lbr
They are the "LOCK" footprints.

There are also Hand soldering footprints with the schematic symbol put on the silkscreen:
